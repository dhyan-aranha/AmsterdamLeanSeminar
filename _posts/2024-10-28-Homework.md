title: Homework for 04/11/2024

For our next meeting please have a look at the following sections:

Section 09, bijections and isomorphisms: Sheets 1,2,3,4

The plan is to do Section 10 on topological spaces together in the seminar, I think sheet 1 of topological spaces may be a little tricky so it probably better to have a look at it before our meeting!
