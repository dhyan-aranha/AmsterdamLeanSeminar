title: Homework for 28/10/2024
---

For our meeting next week please have a look at sections:

Subgroups and Homomorphisms: Sheet 1, Sheet 2 (except the last few examples) 
Finiteness: Sheet 1, 2, 3


We'll plan to look through the last few examples of sheet 2 and sheet 3 of Subgroups all together, which I hope will be more fun to solve collaboratively. If we go through that quickly then we can try sheets 1 and 2 of bijections as well which looks interesting.
