For next time please have a look at:

Groups: Sheets 1-2
Orderings and Lattices : Sheets 1- 3

We will try and solve Groups sheet 3 and Orderings and Lattices sheet 4 all together. There is only one question on Orderings and Lattices Sheet 3 and Buzzard writes it is a "harder" question please have a look at it and we can decide if its worth working on/discussing as a group.

Also: Next week we return to our old room F 3.20
