Here are some useful links and references for our seminar:

[Kevin Buzzard's course repository](https://github.com/ImperialCollegeLondon/formalising-mathematics-2024/): This will be the primary reference of our seminar. 

[Mathlib](https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/)

[The Informal Formalization Seminar in Utrecht](https://jcommelin.github.io/informal-formalization-seminar/)

[Theorem Proving in Lean](https://lean-lang.org/theorem_proving_in_lean4/title_page.html): This reference is here because it gets into what is going on "under the hood" of lean.

[Mathematics in Lean textbook](https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathematics_in_lean/)

[The Natural Numbers Game](https://adam.math.hhu.de)

[Mir's Masters Thesis](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/media/imperial-college/faculty-of-engineering/computing/public/1819-ug-projects/Fernandez-I-MirR-Schemes-in-Lean.pdf): Explains how to formalize the notion of scheme (in Lean 3). 

[Buzzard's Xena project](https://www.ma.imperial.ac.uk/~buzzard/xena/): Contains many of the above links plus many more!
