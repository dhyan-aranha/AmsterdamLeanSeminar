[Formalising Mathematics](https://www.ma.imperial.ac.uk/~buzzard/xena/formalising-mathematics-2024/Introduction/introduction.html).

Please see the section [Installing Lean](https://www.ma.imperial.ac.uk/~buzzard/xena/formalising-mathematics-2024/Introduction/install.html), for information on installing Lean4 on your machine. It will also be helpful to download and install the [course repository](https://github.com/ImperialCollegeLondon/formalising-mathematics-2024/), for this you will need to install git on your computer.

We will meet every Monday from 3 - 5 pm in room F3.20 in the KdVI building. If you have futher questions please don't hesitate to contact  me at: d.v.aranha at uva.nl.
